## Local Setup

- Create a directory with whatever name fancy and make a `venv` virtual environment
- activate the virtual environment
- clone this repo inside the same directory.
- navigate inside the repo and use `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install dependencies
- create a `config.json` following `config.example.json`
- finally run `main.py` to get email of connections. It can be found in `Outputs/outputs.json`

* Currently only linkedin scraping works
* selenium is used to scrape data.
* google scraping is under process
